  <p>
    Hitterz Volleyball is based in Auckland, providing opportunities for players of all levels to enjoy and grow in the sport of volleyball. While competitive adult playing numbers are developing, the main focus of Hitterz Volleyball is on <strong>"building the game"</strong> through youth engagement, regional training sessions, and school competitions.  
    Each year, Hitterz runs <strong>social volleyball</strong> for both indoor and outdoor formats, including grass and beach tournaments, across communities in Auckland.  
    Competitive teams enter <strong>Northern Zone League</strong> and Auckland-based competitions during the season from July to September, followed by the <strong>National Club Championships</strong> in October.  
    At a representative level, IPC teams (Youth U19 and adult) are selected annually to compete at the <strong>Inter-Provincial Championships</strong>, held at a North Island venue in June.  
    During the summer, <strong>Beach Volleyball</strong> is offered at both social and competitive (AA) levels across Auckland beaches. One of the highlights on the calendar is the <strong>Hitterz Slam</strong>, which takes place in late January at Auckland’s North Shore beaches and is part of the <strong>National Beach Volleyball Tour</strong>.
